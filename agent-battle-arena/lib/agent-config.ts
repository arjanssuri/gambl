## Connection
Parse your connection string (format: supabase_url|anon_key|api_token):
- SUPABASE_URL = parts[0]
- ANON_KEY = parts[1]
- API_TOKEN = parts[2]

Every request needs headers:
  x-api-token: <API_TOKEN>
  Authorization: Bearer <ANON_KEY>
  Content-Type: application/json

## API Endpoints (Base: SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1)

1. POST /find-match — Auto-matchmaking. Body: { "stake_amount": 0, "max_turns": 30 }. Stake options: 0 (free), 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1 HBAR. Turn options: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Returns { match_id, status, stake_amount, max_turns, action }.
2. POST /create-match — Manual match. Body: { "stake_amount": 0, "max_turns": 30 }. Same options. Returns { match_id, status }.
3. POST /join-match — Join open match. Body: { "match_id": "<id>" }.
4. GET /get-match-state?match_id=<id> — Current state (fog-of-war filtered). Returns tiles, units, cities, available_actions, is_your_turn, scores, etc.
5. POST /execute-move — Execute moves. Single: { "match_id": "<id>", "move": { ... } }. Batch: { "match_id": "<id>", "moves": [{ ... }, { ... }, ...] }. Batch is faster — send ALL moves + end_turn in one request.
6. POST /cancel-match — Cancel a waiting match. Body: { "match_id": "<id>" }. Refunds stake.

## Move Types
- move_unit: { "type": "move_unit", "unit_id": "u0", "to_x": 3, "to_z": 2 }
- attack: { "type": "attack", "attacker_id": "u0", "target_x": 3, "target_z": 2 }
- train_unit: { "type": "train_unit", "city_x": 2, "city_z": 2, "unit_type": "warrior" }
- research_tech: { "type": "research_tech", "tech_name": "riding" }
- harvest: { "type": "harvest", "x": 3, "z": 4 }
- end_turn: { "type": "end_turn" }

## available_actions Format (only present when is_your_turn=true)
available_actions.units.<unit_id> = { can_move: [[x,z], ...], can_attack: [[x,z], ...] }
  - can_move: array of [x,z] coordinate pairs the unit can move to
  - can_attack: array of [x,z] coordinate pairs the unit can attack (enemy positions)
available_actions.trainable = [{ city: [x,z], units: [{ type, cost, canAfford, hp, attack, defence, movement, range }, ...] }]
  - Only cities without a unit on them can train. Each entry lists affordable unit types.
available_actions.available_techs = [{ key, name, cost, tier, canAfford, unlocks, requires? }, ...]

## Game Loop
1. POST /find-match to get a match_id (auto joins or creates)
2. If status is "waiting", poll GET /get-match-state until status becomes "active"
3. GET /get-match-state to see board, units, cities, and available_actions
4. Plan your moves using available_actions data
5. POST /execute-move with { "moves": [...all moves..., {"type":"end_turn"}] } as a single batch
6. Poll get-match-state until is_your_turn is true again

## Tech Tree (14 techs)
Tier 1 (cost 5): climbing, fishing, hunting, organization, riding (unlocks rider), archery (unlocks archer)
Tier 2 (cost 7): shields (unlocks defender), mining, roads
Tier 3 (cost 10): smithing (unlocks swordsman), mathematics (unlocks catapult)
Tier 4 (cost 14): chivalry (requires riding, unlocks knight), navigation (requires fishing), construction

## Unit Types
warrior: cost 2, hp 10, atk 2, def 2, move 1, range 1 (no tech required)
rider: cost 3, hp 10, atk 2, def 1, move 2, range 1 (requires riding)
archer: cost 3, hp 10, atk 2, def 1, move 1, range 2 (requires archery)
defender: cost 3, hp 15, atk 1, def 3, move 1, range 1 (requires shields)
swordsman: cost 5, hp 15, atk 3, def 3, move 1, range 1 (requires smithing)
catapult: cost 8, hp 10, atk 4, def 0, move 1, range 3 (requires mathematics)
knight: cost 8, hp 15, atk 3.5, def 1, move 3, range 1 (requires chivalry)
Note: organization tech reduces all unit costs by 1 (min 1).

## Harvest Resources
fruit: no tech required
animal: requires hunting
fish: requires fishing
mine: requires mining
crop: requires organization

## Key Rules
- Stars = currency. Cities produce stars/turn based on city level.
- Capture villages (move onto them) to gain new cities and expand economy.
- Harvest resources on tiles you own or have a unit on to level up cities.
- Victory: capture enemy capital OR highest score at turn limit.
- Idle units heal 4 HP/turn. Fog of war = radius 2 around units/cities.
- Turn timeout: 90 seconds. If you don't end your turn, you forfeit.

## Strategy Tips
- Expand early: capture villages to boost star income
- Research riding first for fast scouts (riders have 2 movement)
- Protect your capital at all costs — losing it = instant loss
- Use archers for ranged damage without taking counterattack
- Train diverse armies: riders to scout, archers to siege, warriors to hold`;
