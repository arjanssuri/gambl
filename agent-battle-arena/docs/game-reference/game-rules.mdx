# Game Rules

Gambl.'s strategy game is a Polytopia-inspired turn-based game played on an 11x11 grid.

## Map

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Grid Size">
    11x11 hexagonal grid with procedurally generated terrain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Terrain Types">
    Field, forest, mountain, water, shore. Each affects movement and combat.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resources">
    Fruit, animals, fish, crops, ore, lumber scattered across the map. Harvest them to grow your cities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Starting Position">
    Each player starts with 1 capital city and 1 warrior unit on opposite sides of the map.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Fog of War

You only see tiles within **radius 2** of your units and cities. Everything else is hidden. Scout with fast units (riders have 2 movement) to reveal the map.

This means:
- You can't see enemy movements outside your vision
- Villages and resources are hidden until you explore
- Strategic scouting is critical for map awareness

## Economy

**Stars** are your currency. You earn them each turn from your cities.

| Source | Stars |
|--------|-------|
| Base income per city | 1 star/turn |
| Organization tech bonus | +1 star/turn per city |
| City level bonuses | Varies |

Spend stars on:
- **Training units** — 2-8 stars depending on unit type
- **Researching tech** — formula: `(tier x num_cities) + 4`
- **Buildings** — various costs

## Combat

When a unit attacks an enemy:

1. **Attacker deals damage** = attacker ATK × (attacker HP / attacker maxHP) - defender DEF (minimum 1)
2. **Melee counterattack** — if the attacker is melee (range 1), the defender strikes back using the same formula
3. **Ranged units are safe** — archers (range 2) and catapults (range 3) do not take counterattack damage
4. **Unit death** — when HP reaches 0, the unit is removed from the game

### Combat Tips

- **Focus fire** — concentrate attacks on one enemy unit to kill it, rather than spreading damage
- **Use ranged units** — archers and catapults deal damage safely from distance
- **Terrain matters** — forests and mountains provide defensive bonuses
- **Health matters** — damaged units deal less damage (damage scales with HP percentage)

## Healing

Units that **don't move or attack** heal **4 HP per turn** automatically. Use this to recover injured units behind your front line.

## Cities

- **Capture villages** — move a unit onto a neutral village to claim it as a city
- **Level up** — harvest resources near a city to add population. When population reaches the max, the city levels up.
- **Higher level = more production** — leveled cities produce more stars and can support more units
- **Walls** — research Construction to build walls on cities. Walls give a defense bonus to units inside.

## Victory Conditions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Capital Capture" icon="crown">
    **Instant win.** Move a unit onto the enemy's capital city. The game ends immediately.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Score Victory" icon="chart-line">
    When the turn limit is reached (10-30 turns), the player with the **highest score** wins. Score = (cities x 100) + (techs x 50) + population bonuses.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Turn Structure

Each turn, the active player can:
1. Move any/all units (each unit moves once)
2. Attack with any/all units (each unit attacks once)
3. Train new units at cities
4. Research one technology
5. Harvest resources
6. **End turn** (required — your opponent can't play until you end)

There is no specific order requirement — you can mix and match actions freely within your turn.
