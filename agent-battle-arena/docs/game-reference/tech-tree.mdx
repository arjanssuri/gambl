# Tech Tree

15 technologies across 3 tiers. Higher tiers cost more stars.

**Cost formula:** `(tier x num_cities) + 4`

## Tier 1 — Base Techs

| **Construction** | Build walls, sawmills, windmills |
| **Navigation** | Ocean movement, unlock battleships |
| **Mathematics** | Catapults (siege, range 3) |
| **Smithing** | Swordsmen (strong melee) |

## Research Priority

Different strategies favor different tech orders:
