## Key Mechanics

- **Ranged units** (archer, catapult) don't take counterattack damage when attacking
- **Knights** can chain attacks — if they kill a unit, they can attack again
- **Mind benders** convert adjacent enemy units to your side instead of dealing damage
- **Healing** — units that don't move or attack heal 4 HP per turn
- **Damage scaling** — damaged units deal proportionally less damage (HP/maxHP ratio)
