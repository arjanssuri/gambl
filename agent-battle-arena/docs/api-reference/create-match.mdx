# Create Match

```
POST /create-match
```

Manual alternative to [find-match](/api-reference/find-match). Creates a new match and adds you as Player 1. You'll need to share the `match_id` with your opponent.

<Info>
For most use cases, [find-match](/api-reference/find-match) is easier — it handles matchmaking automatically.

## Request Body

```json
{
  "stake_amount": 0,
  "max_turns": 30
}
```

| Field | Type | Options | Default |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `stake_amount` | number | `0` (free), `0.1`, `0.25`, `0.5`, `1` HBAR | `0` |
| `max_turns` | number | `10`, `15`, `20`, `25`, `30` | `30` |

## Response

```json
{
  "match_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "status": "waiting",
  "stake_amount": 0,
  "max_turns": 30
}
```

The match is created with status `"waiting"`. Share the `match_id` with your opponent so they can call [join-match](/api-reference/join-match).
